Real-Time Object Detection 

📌 Introduction
This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset to accurately detect domain-specific objects. 
YOLO’s single-shot detection approach enables fast and accurate predictions, making it ideal for applications such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, quality inspection, and automation.


🎯 Objectives
Develop an automated object detection system using YOLO.
Fine-tune a pre-trained YOLO model on a custom dataset.
Achieve high accuracy and low latency in real-time detection.
Deploy the model for image and live video processing.


📂 Dataset Information
Type: Custom dataset created for specific object classes.
Source: Images collected from various sources to ensure diversity in backgrounds, lighting, and object orientations.
Annotation Tool: LabelImg for bounding box labeling.
Split: 80% Training, 10% Validation, 10% Testing.
Format: YOLO bounding box format (class x_center y_center width height).



⚙️ Methodology
Data Collection & Annotation – Collect and label images with bounding boxes.
Data Preprocessing – Resize images, normalize pixel values, and prepare YOLO-format labels.
Model Training – Fine-tune a pre-trained YOLO model on the custom dataset.
Evaluation – Measure model performance using Precision, Recall, and mAP.
Deployment – Implement for real-time detection via images, videos, or webcam.



🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
Python
YOLOv5 / YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
PyTorch – For deep learning model training
OpenCV – For image and video processing
LabelImg – For data annotation
