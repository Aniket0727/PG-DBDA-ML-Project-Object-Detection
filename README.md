** Object Detection Project **

Description:
This project implements an Object Detection system in Python using machine learning and computer vision techniques. It can detect and classify multiple objects in images or videos, draw bounding boxes around them, and optionally save the output. The project supports real-time detection via webcam and uses pretrained models for accurate recognition.


Key Features:

Detects multiple objects in images and videos
Draws bounding boxes with labels
Real-time detection with webcam input
Option to save processed images/videos
Uses pretrained models for high accuracy


Technologies Used:

Python 3.12
OpenCV
TensorFlow / PyTorch (for object detection models)
Numpy
